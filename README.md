**CSS:**

Cascading Style Sheet is a stylesheet language used to define the presentation and layout of a webpage written in HTML or XML. CSS follows a cascading hierarchy, where styles defined at a higher level in the stylesheet cascade down to affect the lower-level elements. CSS is now an essential part of web development in conjunction with HTML and Javascript. CSS has a file extension of .css.

**SCSS:** 

Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet SCSS (Sassy CSS) is a preprocessor scripting language that is a superset of CSS. It provides additional features and functionalities that are not available in regular CSS. SCSS syntax is very similar to CSS, but it allows for the use of variables, nesting, mixins, and other programming constructs. SCSS has a file extension of .scss.
